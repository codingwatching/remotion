If the user drops in any image, audio, video or GIF, you can configure them to be uploaded to an S3 bucket.

## Setup

- Visit the [S3 console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1).
- Create a new bucket.
  - Uncheck the "Block all public access" checkbox.
  - Disable ACL - if you don't do this, you will get a 400 error when later uploading assets.
- In the bucket settings, go to the "Permissions" tab and enter the following policy into the "CORS" section:

```json
[
	{
		"AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
		"AllowedMethods": ["PUT", "GET", "HEAD"],
		"AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
		"ExposeHeaders": [],
		"MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
	}
]
```

- Go to [IAM -> "Users"](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/users) in the AWS console.
- Create a new user with all settings left as default.
- Click "Add permissions -> Add inline policy" and add the following policy:

```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "Presign",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:PutObjectAcl"],
			"Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"]
		}
	]
}
```

:::note
Make sure to replace `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME` with the name of your bucket.
:::

- Click "Security credentials".
- Click "Create access key". Select "CLI" as use case.
- Save your access key and secret access key.

In your `.env` file, fill now the following variables:

```txt
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_REGION=
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=
```

Now, restart the Editor Starter.  
When you drop in an asset, it should be uploaded to the S3 bucket!
